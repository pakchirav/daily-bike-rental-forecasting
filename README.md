# Daily Bike Rental Forecasting 🚲

## 📌 Project Overview
A time-series forecasting project to predict daily bike rental demand using SARIMA/SARIMAX models. This project aims to help optimize resource allocation for rental stations.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Time Series Analysis:** Conducted decomposition to identify seasonal trends and cyclic patterns.
2. **Modeling:** Developed **SARIMA** and **SARIMAX** models to handle seasonality and external factors (e.g., weather, holidays).
3. **Evaluation:** Measured forecast accuracy to ensure reliability for business planning.

## 📈 Business Insights
* Highlighted key factors influencing rental volume (e.g., temperature, working days vs. weekends).
* Provided data-driven recommendations for fleet management and inventory distribution.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Python (Statsmodels, Pandas)
* Time Series Analysis (SARIMA, SARIMAX)
* Data Visualization
